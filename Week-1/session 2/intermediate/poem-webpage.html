        I'm Nobody! Who are you? <br>
        Are you - Nobody - too?  <br>
        Then there's a pair of us! <br>
        Dont tell! they'd advertise - you know!<br>
        <br>
        How dreary - to be - Somebody!<br>
        How public - like a Frog -<br>
        To tell one's name - the livelong June -<br>
        To an admiring Bog!<br>
